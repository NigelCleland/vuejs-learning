# Motivation for learning [VueJS](https://vuejs.org)

I want to learn VueJS as I need to be able to get applications in front of people in an interactive fashion. 
At this stage I'm okay with building data heavy backends using Python, particularly the scientific stack, but
I don't have a great method of getting this into a production environment.

VueJS looks like a nice introduction into the JS landscape that isn't too crazy.
