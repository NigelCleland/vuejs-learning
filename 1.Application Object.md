# The VueJS Application Object

One of the simplest VueJS apps can be written as follows:

### HTML

```html

<div id='app'>
  <h2>{{ title }}</h2>
</div

```

### JS

```javascript
new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    title: 'Hello World!'
  }
})
```

## How this works

The **Vue** object is looking for an ID named 'app'. If it was '.app' it would look for the first class of that name. 
This *binds* the Vue object to the div and thus allows the Vue framework to manipulate the div.

The moustaches (curly braces) have access to the namespaces of the Vue object directly without having to call any other primitives. 
There are special reserved namespaces including:

* data -> Stores data about the object in a 'key-value' style approach
* methods -> Stores functions that can manipulate the data in the object 
* computed -> Computed objects are similar to methods however they're more computationally efficient. Accessed in the same way as properties (data)
* watch -> Watches a particular property and will run some code when the value changes. Useful for Asynchronous Tasks to run in the background. Computed is better for Synchronous tasks.

```javascript
watch: {
  counter: function(value) {
    var vm = this; // Note. Using Clojure so must access and store 'this' to have access to it.
    setTimeout(function() {
      vm.counter = 0 // Reset counter to 0 after 2 seconds.
    }, 2000);
  }
}
```
